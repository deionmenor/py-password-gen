# py-password-gen
PROJECT:
Weak passwords are no good. Create a Python command line application that generates a S T R O N G and secure password for your accounts

- Passwords should be secure, must have alphanumeric characters and non-alphanumeric characters (!?#$% and so on), and should be of a certain length (up to you)
- Passwords should also be memorable. Relevant XKCD. Maybe get your passwords from a list of generic words ( or multiple lists even)
- Plus points if you could also design a function that checks a given stringâ€™s password strength (if the user already has a password in mind)
- Skills Required
    - Input/Output
    - String Manipulation
    - Error handling
